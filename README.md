[BUG REPORTING](https://github.com/flegald/GZDeck/issues)

Notes:
---
I recommend setting up GZDoom first with a mouse and keyboard for first time launch.

*A note or two on `--no-sandbox`.
* Failure to set this flag may cause steam to hang.
* This application does not and will not have any network functionality due to this limitation.
